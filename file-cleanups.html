        <li >This was written to keep the /scratch filesystem clean, but without
          users losing results from their MAGMA runs.<br>
        <li>At 1:00 AM every Saturday, script <b>/usr/local/SAbin/magma-move</b>
          runs, and moves files older than a certain age (age given on
          command-line, currently 150 days) from
          <b>/scratch/home/<i>user</i>/MAGMAprojects</b>
          to <b>/home/<i>user</i>/MAGMAprojects</b> (which resides on
          <b>whqnt777</b>).  An "ls -l" of all of the files moved is left in
           <b>/usr/local/SAdata/magma-move/<i>YYYY-MM-DD</i>.log</b>
          (organized by user).  In addition, a brief report of space in /scratch
          before and after the cleanup is reported at the end of this file.
        <li>No E-mail report is currently being sent.
        <li>This was last implemented many years ago, and received
          sigificant updates by Wayne Brehob in November, 2016.
