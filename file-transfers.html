changing soon.

    <td>Engineering file transfers
    <td>
      Engineers in Pune and AHQ, working with engineering teams in the
      United States, may need to transfer large files between their location
      and.  Transfers can take a long time, so it's inconvenient for the
      engineers to run WinSCP or the like from their desktop, so another
      method was devised:  Users place files in a particular folder
      on the file server at their location, and these files get transferred
      to WHQ the next time the file-transfer process runs.  To get files
      from WHQ back to their site, they simply place them in a location at
      WHQ and they will be sent to their site.  This describes the process
      that transfers the files.

      <li>On <b>whqlx40</b>, at system boot, or on demand,
       <b>/sbin/init.d/file-movers</b> starts an instance of
       <b>/usr/local/SAbin/file-mover</b> for each line in the table below
       (with command-line arguments to tell it which transfer it is handling).

      <li>
       The transfers (above) are listed in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/file-movers</tt>
      <li>
       Each instance of
       <b>/usr/local/SAbin/file-mover</b> runs <b>rsync</b> every 15 minutes,
       or after the previous transfer is done, whichever is longer.
      <li>The <b>rsync</b> transfers any files in the source directory
       to the destination directory, and removes the files in the source
       directory after they have successfully been transferred.
      <li>Extended logging is written to files
       <b>/usr/local/SAdata/file-mover/<i>remote-host-name.D.date</i>.log</b>
       (<b><i>D</i></b> is direction of transfer, <b>s</b> for send, <b>r</b>
       for receive).
      <li>Every day at 4:10 AM <b>whqlx111</b> reads the extended log files
       from the previous day and produces a short report listing the files
       transferred, and the total number of MB transferred, in each direction.
       These reports can be found <a href=/engr/transfer-logs/>here</a>.
      <li>There is some extended documentation on the configuration of the
       remote systems <b><a href=cwrsync.html>here</a></b>.
      </ul>
  <tr>
    <td>PLM replication
    <td>
      Engineering teams in several offices work on product designs that include
      many of the same files.  The files are managed by PLM (Product Lifecycle
      Management) software running in WHQ.  It's not possible for the remote
      offices to read these files at a reasonable speed over the WAN, so
      the files are copied from the PLM server at at WHQ to a Windows server at
      each remote site.  The folder on the remote Windows system is considered
      read-only, so any changes made to the files there would be overwritten by
      files from WHQ on the next synchronization.
     <p>
      More specifically, on <b>whqlx06</b> (the PLM server) in
      <b>/plm_vaults</b> are 4 additional directories:  
      <b>plm_cat4 plm_cat5 plm_nx plm_ptc</b>.  These are copied to
      folders with the same names on destination Windows systems (listed below)
      running <b>cwRsyncServer</b> (rsync server based on CygWin).
      A full 'rsync' is run once a day, then for all other cycles that day,
      only files whose timestamps have been updated are given to 'rsync'
      to compare and likely send.
      The full 'rsync' is run at a different time for each site
      in an attempt to run when neither sending nor receiving system is busy.
      <table border=1>
        <tr>
          <th>Location			<th>host & drive
          <th>Windows share		<th>full sync.<br>time (EST)

      </table>
      The synchronization for each site is handled by script
      <b>/usr/local/SAbin/plm-replicate</b>, running as user <b>plmrep</b>.
     <br>On system boot, script <b>/etc/init.d/plmrep</b> starts an instance of
      <b>plm-replicate</b> for each destination system.  Each of these runs
      until killed, continually checing for changes and running 'rsync'.
      Further documentation for this script is in comments in the script.
      Each script writes to a log file:
       <b>/usr/local/SAdata/replication_logs/plm_rsync_<i>remote-host</i>P_<i>YYYYMMDD</i>.log</b> (a new file is created every day).
      <br><b>/usr/local/SAdata/replication_logs</b> is exported and the log
       files are used to produce Excel reports (with graphs) on bytes
       transferred and 'rsync' cycle time.
     <p>
      Other misc. details:<ul>
        <li>A cron job  in plmrep's crontab runs every 2 hours to make
         sure all replication jobs are running and making progress.  If the
	 jobs are not making progress or are getting errors when trying to
	 connect to the Windows systems, an E-mail message is sent to the
	 UNIX team with instructions on what needs to be done to fix it.
         This script is: <b>/usr/local/SAbin/check-plmrep</b>
        <li>The destination filesystems are all 1.5 TB, so if the synchronized
         data ever exceeds that, all destination filelsystems must be expanded.
        <li>Because the TCP connection established by 'rsync' may go idle
         for extended periods of time while file checksums are computed,
         the firewalls between WHQ and each site have a special rule that
         extends the TCP timeout for 'rsync' traffic:
         <br>set timeout 7200
         <br>set start port 873
         <br>set stop port 873
        <li>There is some extended documentation on the configuration of the
          remote systems <b><a href=cwrsync.html>here</a></b>.
      </ul>
     <p>
  <tr>
    <td>Repliweb
    <td>
      In RHTC, test cell computers have large files containing test data.
      These files are moved to <b>ROCNT250</b> by <b>Repliweb</b> software
      running on <b>ROCNT44DEV</b> (soon <b>ROCNT45</b>).  Contact the CAE
      support team if you want technical details on the process.
