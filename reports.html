<title>CAE Reports</title>
</head><body>

This page contains a list of reports run on CAE
(Computer Aided Engineering) compute systems,
primarily geared toward those run on Linux.
<br>
The purpose of this page is to give a general overview of how data is
retreieved, where it is retrieved from, and where the output is written.
To fully understand the process, the scripts [should] contain more detailed
documentation in the comments.  If not, you can always read the code itself.

There is a script that runs as </b>kukretm</b> and collects CAD software
license usage information.  Wayne is currently trying to get documentation
on this process.
<!-- INC0032455 may have more information on this, if I really need to scrounge
 for it -->

<b>CAE Capacity Usage report</b> 
<td>
CapacityUsageReport runs on whqlx40, punlx07, and fralx07 at 8am every morning<br>

<b>Job Logs</b>
<br>
<td>Each time a compute job is run (Abaqus, NX Nastran, STAR CCM, etc.),
a log file is produced on the compute node in
<b>/scratch/joblogs/<i>code</i>/<i>jobname</i>.log</b> where
<i>code</i> is the name of the compute code, and <i>jobname</i> is the name of the job, as picked by the user (based on the input file name?).
The log file contains the times that the job started and stoped.

<p>
<b>whqlx20</b>:/home/caxrpt/bin/<b>get-all-job-times</b> is a script
which gathers statistics from these jobs.  It is intended to be
run as the <b>caxrpt</b> user.
This is what it does:
<ol>
  <li>Creates a script which will be used as a subroutine, of sorts.
  <li>For each site (currently <b>WHQ</b> and <b>PBO</b>).
    <ul>
      <li>Start writing to data to <b><i>site</i>.jobs.txt</b>
      <li>For each compute system at that site
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the subroutine over (caxrpt user has authorized_keys setup
            to do so without a password prompt)
          <li>Connect via SSH and run the subroutine, which...
          <li>For <i>code</i> in <b>abaqus</b>, <b>nxnastran</b>,
            <b>starccm+</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Look in every file named /scratch/joblogs/<i>code</i>/*.log
               for a start time and a stop time (the strings that are searched
               for and the time format are different for each code).
              <li>Print a line that looks something like this (using tabs as
               field separators):<br>
               jobname.job &nbsp; code &nbsp; user &nbsp; run-host &nbsp;
                start-time &nbsp; end-time
            </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>The <b><i>site</i>.jobs.txt</b> file is now complete
  </ul>

<b>6-hour jobs report</b>
<br>
<td>
On <b>whqlx02</b> (LSF head node) <b>/usr/local/SAbin/lsf_queue_rpt.sh</b>
runs every 6 hours.  It runs a <b>bjobs -u all</b>, and appends that to
<b>/scratch/caehome/caehpc/6hrsreport/whqlx02_jobs6hrs.txt</b>,
every line prefaced with the date/time that the "bjobs" command was run.
In addition, a "bjobs -u all" is E-mailed to these E-mail addresses:
  ravikumar.boragal@corp.aam.net, michael.carlo@corp.aam.net,
  sandya.shankar@corp.aam.net, charlie.sweeny@corp.aam.net
