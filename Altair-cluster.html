<font size="+2"><b>How to give a CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) user ability
to run jobs on 'hwul2'</b></font> (the Altair HyperWorks UnLimited cluster,
2nd iteration):<p>
These instructions include the steps require to fully create the account on the
Altair cluster, which was approved by Dale Dunlap of Altair, 2018-11-09.
<!--<br><font color=red>Well, they do not actually include them all yet, since this
 procedure is still under construction, but the in <b>intent</b> is that this
 procedure will include all the steps when it is finished</font>
-->
<p><i>Note:</i> All references to <b>whqcax</b> in the procedure below may be
 replaced by the name of the server on which the 'hpcq' script is run,<br>
 from. e.g. <b>fralx07</b> or punlx07</b>, for cases in which Engineers from
 different sites wish to utilize the WHQ Altair cluster.<p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the user has an account on <b>whqcax</b>, add them
   to the <b>optistruct</b> group, and grab their SSH key.<tt>
    <br>user=<i>username-getting-OptiStruct-access</i>
    <br>usermod -G -a optistruct $user
    <br>cat ~$user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    </tt><p>
	<b> N.B.: perform an nslookup of whqlx36.aam.net to get the correct IP address </b><br>
	
  <li><p> For an existing user who can submit ABAQUS jobs from whqlx36, this key will already be listed in whqlx02:/home/$user/.ssh/authorized_keys.<br>
    <p>It should look something like this.<br>
   
   from="172.30.60.57" ssh-rsa ...long encrypted string... wwwrun@whqlx36
) <br>
   copy this for adding to the user's <b> hwul2 </b> ssh authorized_keys below.
<p>
   <li> If this is a new user who had no previous whqlx36 web page access, <br>
   on <b>whqlx36</b> as 'root' or 'wwwrun', link 'wwwrun's SSH key file
   for the user and <br> 
   print the text that will be added to the user's authorized_keys file on whqlx40 <p>(This gives the user access to use the
   <a href="http://whqlx36/">whqlx36 web interface</a>):<tt> <br>
   
    <br>user=<i>same_as_AD_but_lowercase</i>
    <br>if [ -n "$user" ]; then
    <br>&nbsp; cd ~wwwrun/.ssh

    <br>&nbsp; ln id_rsa.pub $user.pub
    <br>&nbsp; ip=$(grep $(hostname) /etc/hosts | awk '/^#/ {next};{print $1; exit}')

    <br># Copy the text that this prints for the next step.

 <!--
  </p></li><li>Ask the CAE support team to contact Altair (usually
   <a href="mailto:dale.dunlap@altair.com">Dale Dunlap</a>) to
   request an account on the optistruct head node.  Send the user's
   SSH key (obtained in previous step).<p>
-->
	<li> Create the user on <b>hwul2</b>, using the same uid, gid, name and account as on whqlx40
	<br>To create a new user:
	<ol>
	<li>- look for their uid/gid on whqlx20
	<li>- run useradd with uid/gid found above<br>
		<br>useradd -u $uid -g $gid -c "$f $l, $s" $user
	
		<br>
		<br><b>Example:</b> useradd -u 4076 -g 2500 -c "Jerry Chung,RHTC,248-299-6426," chungj<br>
	<br><li>- set password for userid to useridHWUL<br>
	<br><li>- cd /var/yp; make<br>
<!--
	<li>- service rpcidmapd restart -->

	<br><li>- su - to userid<br>
	(This will create their ssh keys (private key id_dsa and public key id_dsa.pub) )<br>
	<br><li> Add the public ssh keys for whqlx40 and whqlx36 and/or whqlx36dev to the user's 'authorized_keys' file <br>
	<br><li>- set up email forwarding:  edit .forward, add:<br>
		first.last@aam.com <br>
		<b>Example:</b>Stewart.McKenna@aam.com<br>
   <br><li>- run pas-passwd<br>
   <br><li>- run "pdsh -w r01n07 uptime"  <br>
		<br>(The compute nodes are r01n01-r01n08)<br>
 <!--
   <li>- ssh to a compute node, then ssh to admin
-->
	<br><li>- login to CM as user <br>
	(This will create the /stage/userid folder that is needed to run jobs on the cluster)
</ol>
 <!--	
   <li></p><p> The following directory on <b> hwul2 </b> can be used to move/copy keys
	<b>hwul2:/stage/new_users</b>
</p>
<ol>
	<li>	You put <b>both the public key</b> for the new user from whqlx40, <b>and</b>the public key from whqlx36 above in:<br>
	hwul2:/stage/new_users/&lt;"username"&gt;.id_rsa.pub
	<li>	Create the user on hwul2, and put the public key into their ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	<li>	When done delete the key from /stage/new_users
<br>
	<br>
</li></ol>
<!--
  </li><li>Altair will create new account on the cluster, and add the user's SSH
   key you sent to the user's authorized_keys file on <b>hwul2</b>.<p>
  <li> Altair creates the hwul2 users key and puts it in <b>/stage/new_users</b>.
  <br>
  <ol> 
  <li> This will be hwul2:/stage/new_users/&lt;"username"&gt;.id_dsa.pub
  <li> Put this key into their ~/.ssh/known_hosts on whqlx40
  <li> When done, delete the key from /stage/new_users
  <li> Append it to the user's authorized_keys file on whqlx40. 
  </ol>
  <br>

</b>
-->
  
  </li><li>On <b>whqlx40 as the user</b>, check the user's acces to <b>hwul2</b>,
  copy the id_dsa.pub key from their account on <b>hwul2</b> and append it to their
  <b>authorized_keys</b> file on whqlx40.
<!--
   generate an SSH key there, and add it to their authorized_keys file
-->
   so that results can be copied back.
<!--
   <br>Do these steps one at a time to ensure that each is successful before
   proceeding to the next.<tt>
