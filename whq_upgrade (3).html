1.	PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION
Procedure to upgrade the WHQ LSF head node to LSF Spectrum 10.1.
(Assumption: whqlx30 will be the new head node while whqlx02 is being rebuilt)
2.	PROCEDURE STEPS
	1.	Install SLES 12SP3 on the new head node – ( Determine the host to be used as a backup LSF head node - whql30)
	2.	Add whqlx30 to cluster as an LSF client	  -  done (new host is not in production – so no impact)
	        copy /etc/auto.auto from whqlx02

		Set LSF_TOP
		Export LSF_TOP=”/usr/shared/lsf”
		Execute the command to set the LSF environment
		.   $LSF_TOP/conf/profile.lsf
		Run the hostsetup command

		/usr/shared/lsf/9.1/install/hostsetup –-top=”/auto/lsf” –-boot=”y”

		Run systemctl start lsf.service

		Execute lsadmin limstartup

		Execute lsadmin resstartup

		Execute badmin hstartup

	3.	Shutdown LSF on all head and compute nodes ( whqlx02-54,777)
	4.	Mount the new LSF from whqnas03 and sync the data from whqlx02 to whqnas03
		whqnas03:/cae/lsf/AAM_WHQ_cluster1   /auto/lsf

		mount whqnas03:/cae/lsf/AAM_WHQ_cluster1 /mnt
		rsync -avz /usr/shared/lsf/* /mnt
		umount /mnt

	5.	Change the automount on head and compute nodes to mount /auto/lsf on /usr/shared/lsf
		(see notes below)
	
		Replace NFS export from whqlx02 to compute nodes (/etc/exports) with automount from
		whqnas03:/cae/lsf/AAM_WHQ_cluster1

		whqlx02
			remove  /etc/exports
			...
			/usr/shared     whqlx*(rw,no_root_squash,sync) 
			/cae/scratch/home     whqlx*(rw,no_root_squash,sync) 
			
		whqlx02 and all head and compute nodes

			New  /etc/auto.auto
			…
			# These mounts are specific for a compute server
			# The 'cae' mount is just to admin. the root of the FS on the unity
			#
			cae             -fstype=nfs             whqnas03:/cae
			lsf             -fstype=nfs             whqnas03:/cae/lsf/AAM_WHQ_cluster2
			#/cae/AAM_WHQ_cluster2/log/purge
			log             -fstype=nfs             whqnas03:/cae/AAM_WHQ_cluster2/log
			#/cae/AAM_WHQ_cluster2/tmp
			tmp             -fstype=nfs             whqnas03:/cae/AAM_WHQ_cluster2/tmp
			#
	
			Create link to automount of lsf for /usr/shared.lsf
 				ls -l /usr/shared/lsf
				lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Jun 20 07:56 /usr/shared/lsf -> /auto/lsf

	6.	restart autofs 'systemctl restart autofs'
	7. 	Start LSF on new head node (whqlx30)
	8.	Test ( df –h; bhosts)
	9.	Stop /Start LSF on whqlx02, all other compute nodes.
	10.	change whqlx30 on cluster to be a failover head node
		a.	Edit the lsf.cluster.AAM_WHQ_Cluster1 file to add whqlx30 as a client and a head node 
			Begin   Host
			HOSTNAME  model    type        server r1m  mem  swp  RESOURCES    #Keywords
			whqlx02   !   !   1   3.5   ()   ()   (mg)
			...
			whqlx30   !   !   1   3.5   ()   ()   (mg)
			End     Host

		b.	Add whqlx30 to lsb.hosts master_hosts, abaqchk, and nxnast host groups .

		c.	lsadmin ckconfig;lsadmin reconfig

		d.	badmin ckconfig;badmin reconfig;badmin mbdrestart 

	11.	shutdown LSF on whqlx02.

	12.	test that cluster remains up, with whqlx30 as the new head node.
		lsid
		lshosts
		bhosts
		run test job

	13.	Shutdown LSF on all nodes
	14.	Install/upgrade LSF 10.1 on whqlx30 (about 30 minutes)
		(This is actually upgrading the whqnas03 cluster1 lsf filesystem )
	15.	Restart LSF on other compute nodes
	16.	more testing
	17.	Restart LSF on the rest of the compute nodes
	18.	more testing
	19.	update DNS entry for whqlsf to whqlx30.
	20. 	more testing

POST change activities 

1.	Upgrade whqlx02 to SLES12SP3 (this can be done over the course of a few days and is not 
	dependent on anything else)
2.	After whqlx02 has been upgraded, add it back into the cluster
